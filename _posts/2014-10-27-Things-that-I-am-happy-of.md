Our teacher is helping us to see life in different dimensions aside from the usual lesson of programming. And this is one of the challenges she came up with i.e. to write what makes us happy and proud.

In life at every stage there are things that makes you happy and proud of. And two of these are the relationship that I have with my family and the approach in handling kids.

I was born and raised in Asmara-Eritrea which is located in East-Africa neighbored by Egypt and Sudan. Eritrea has nine ethnic groups and I am one of those Tigrigna ethnic groups who mostly reside in highlands. Raised by the values, culture  and beliefs of the community is what made me to be like this. It is a community of sharing and leading life in harmony. Once a baby's born, it's the whole family's responsibility to look after the child, aside the parents. It is a life of caring and sharing in all dimension in good or bad times. Their love, care, and wisdom is what shapes me in every stage of my life and keeps me going. I am really happy and proud to be part of them. 

The second thing is, I was lucky enough to be a teacher of few international elementary and Junior students for almost two years right after my graduation. It was a great opportunity for me to create an attachment with those little creatures of unspoiled and spongy mind. Those were the moments which made me realize the innocence of every creature and to sow all beautiful things in their mind so that they can make the world better than yesterday. Their adventurous mind made me to push them harder to their fullest. And it really showed its result. It makes me happy and skillful to spend sometime with kids.

 So far, these are the two things I am happy and proud of and now looking forward to the enlightenment.
