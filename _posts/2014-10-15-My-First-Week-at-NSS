Sometimes you think you know but you know that you don't know that much once you started implementing of what you thought you knew. 

So being a student in NSS in the my first week has made me to push more to the adventurous world with full of positivity and go dive in.

I have found it interesting, frustrating and rewarding and very condusive environment to learn. 

When I say I found it interesting, there is always something knew you gain daily which is the main thing. Without realizing how far you have gone, you end up with something tangible and beautiful. You don't get ending puzzled.

As it is known good things doesn't come that easily, I can't lie. It is frustrating. So it reminds me to take it easiy, have patience and preservance. And at the same time to relax.

What a rewarding I can say. It made me feel good about myself when I see what I did with what I got trained and how far I could go.

Overall, having a very good condusive environment made it more interesting and acquiring experience for the future.
