In my first week at NSS, I learned the three programming languages which are HTML, CSS and JavaSript. Implementing those languages practically made me to enhance and polish my knowledge. I found it interesting because there was something knew I was gaining daily which was important. Without realizig how far I have gone, I ended up with something tangible and beautiful. Though there were little stressful moments but I never ended up puzzled.
It was rewarding and overall the conducive learning environment made me more to dive in to this next adventure.
